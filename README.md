# BriefNews: A python news summarizer
## Overview
Have you ever clicked on an interesting article just to feel discouraged by the 3 or more pages you have to read to understand it? This python project takes news articles from ScienceNews.org and uses a NLP summarizing technique to shorten the content into only 8 sentences, keeping it brief and easy to digest while still retaining the information. 

The project has two implementations: one using a command line interface that allows you to choose an article topic and gives you every article ScienceNews has featured on the topic on a given day and another that implements a Tkinter GUI that displays a random featured article from a random topic.
